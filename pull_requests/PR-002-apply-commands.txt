PR-002 (repo-cleanup) - Move artifacts to archive and commit

From repo root (PowerShell):

# Create branch
git checkout -b chore/archive-unused-artifacts

# Run the cleanup script to move files to archive (review output)
# This moves files to archive/cleanup-<timestamp>/ but does not change git history yet
.
.
# Execute the script
.\scripts\perform_cleanup.ps1

# Stage the moved files: this will show deletions for original paths and additions under archive/
git add -A

# Commit
git commit -m "chore: archive generated build and backend payload/scripts to archive/cleanup"

# Push branch
git push -u origin chore/archive-unused-artifacts

# Open a PR from this branch to main. The PR should not contain sensitive data.

Notes:
- Inspect the created `archive/cleanup-<timestamp>/` folder before pushing.
- If you prefer to keep some scripts in `backend/scripts/` instead of archive, move them there before committing.
